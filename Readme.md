This class project is about how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data for this project were collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The instructions for this project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
    5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 




=========================================
The datasets associated with this project includes:

1. 'README.md'which provides background information and also explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
2. 'Codebook.md'that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
3. 'data_cleaned.txt' which is a tidy data set generated
4. 'run_analysis.R'which is the R scripts that performed the analysis.
